            <h1>Hello, I'm Ian</h1>
        
            <p> I'm a Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo, as well as
                a former coop at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en">AMD</a>, <a href="https://www.opentext.com/">OpenText</a>, 
                and <a href="https://www.tangamsystems.com/">Tangam Systems Inc</a>.
                In my free time I enjoy coding, tinkering and pushing the limits of 3D printers, electrical hobbywork,
                rock climbing, knifemaking, and blacksmithing. I currently live in Canada
                but completed high school in Texas and have hopes of returning to the US sometime soon.
