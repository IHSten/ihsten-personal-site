This project is the frontend for my personal/portfolio site. It probably could be made with just HTML/CSS, but I chose to add Angular functionality since it's lightweight and allows for extremely easy future functionality, like adding a projects blog, which I plan to do in the near future. The angular functionalities I've left pretty barebones, so all the usual `ng` rules apply.
